# XAF - How to refresh non-persistent objects and reload nested persistent objects


It is often necessary to undo changes made to [non\-persistent objects](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/116516/concepts/business-model-design/non-persistent-objects?v=20.1) in a view. If a non-persistent object has links to persistent objects, it is often required to reload these linked objects as well. However, by default, the built-in **Refresh** action has no effect in these scenarios. This example shows how to refresh data in such cases.

## Implementation Details

To restore a previous non-persistent object state, that state should be kept separately. In this example, data for non-persistent objects is stored in a static collection, and object instances are populated with this data when they are created and reloaded.

1. Create an object map for each [NonPersistentObjectSpace](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace) to keep non-persistent object instances separate. The [ObjectsGetting](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.ObjectsGetting?v=20.1), [ObjectGetting](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.ObjectGetting), and [ObjectByKeyGetting](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.ObjectByKeyGetting) event handlers look for non-persistent objects and add them to the object map. The [Reloaded](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.BaseObjectSpace.Reloaded) event handler clears the object map. Subsequent object queries trigger the creation of new non-persistent object instances that are populated with data from storage.
2. Set the [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AutoReloadAdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AutoReloadAdditionalObjectSpaces?v=20.1) property to `true` to automatically refresh persistent object spaces added to the [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AdditionalObjectSpaces) collection. So, when non-persistent objects are re-created on refresh, they get fresh copies of nested persistent objects. 
3. Set the [NonPersistentObjectSpace\.AutoDisposeAdditionalObjectSpaces](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.NonPersistentObjectSpace.AutoDisposeAdditionalObjectSpaces?v=20.1) property to `true` to automatically dispose of additional object spaces when the non-persistent object space is disposed of. You should dispose of unused object spaces to avoid memory leaks.
4. The non-persistent `LiveSummary` object in this example contains a collection of persistent objects and some derived properties calculated from persistent objects that match parameters. After modifying persistent objects, use the built-in [Refresh](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/DevExpress.ExpressApp.SystemModule.RefreshController.RefreshAction) action to reload non-persistent object views.
